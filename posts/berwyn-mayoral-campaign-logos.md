[](http://jdominiak.com/files/berwyn_campaign_logos.pdf)These campaign logos were designed to provide a visual cue of the candidate’s key messages, build name recognition, and connect the candidate with Berwyn residents. The bold, modern design radiates energy, strength, and optimism and seeks to appeal to youth engagement with the community.
