Hello! I’m a creative professional with a passion for compelling design. I specialize in graphic design for individuals and nonprofit organizations, including libraries, museums, schools, and other cultural institutions. Please scroll down to view my portfolio and to find out more.

When I’m not at work, you might find me checking out a gigantic stack of books at the library with my daughters, dreaming up playful designs for [Flying Pinwheel](https://www.etsy.com/shop/FlyingPinwheel), or exploring sweet home Chicago.
